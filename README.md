# heart_disease_prediction
The project problem is : based on the given information about each individual we have to calculate whether that individual will suffer from heart disease or not.

The following are some important takeaways from the heart disease prediction:

-> Data insight: As previously stated, we will be utilizing the heart disease detection dataset and will draw interesting conclusions from the data to produce meaningful    outcomes.
-> EDA: The most important step for getting meaningful results is exploratory data analysis.
-> Engineering features: In order for the features to proceed to the model-building phase after we have obtained the insights from the data, we must modify them.
-> Building models: We will construct our machine learning model for the detection of heart disease during this phase.
-> Deployment: Results will be shown on web page.
